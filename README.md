# ðŸ“š Evaluation of Mesh Reconstructions from SF3D for Anomaly Detection

Code for 3D anomaly detection using SF3D reconstructions and Graph Autoencoders, developed for my Masterâ€™s Thesis.

This repository contains the code and experiments from my Masterâ€™s Thesis:  
**"Evaluation of the Potential of Mesh Reconstructions from SF3D for Anomaly Detection"**  
*(University of Wuppertal, 2025)*

It integrates **SF3D-based 3D mesh reconstruction** and **Graph Autoencoder (GAE)** anomaly detection â€” all in a unified Jupyter Notebook.
